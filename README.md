# TagSystem
This is meant to be a small experiment in how a tag-based filesystem would be
like to use. The code is far from finished.

## Platform
The code is written for Windows using a service and named pipes. If someone
knows a cross-platform way to acheive the same thing, please let me know.

## Building
CMake files has been provided to quickly set up the project, but there is
currently so few source files that it is likely to be easier to manually set up
a project for them. CMake can be found [here](http://www.cmake.org/).
